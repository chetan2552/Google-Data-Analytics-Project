Overview
Cyclistic
Cyclistic is a leading bike-share company based in Chicago, offering an extensive fleet of over 5,800 bicycles across 600 docking stations. Launched in 2016, Cyclistic has grown to become a key player in the city's transportation ecosystem, providing an environmentally friendly and convenient solution for both locals and visitors. The company stands out by offering a diverse range of bike options, including traditional bikes, reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it accessible for riders with disabilities or those who require special biking options. Cyclistic operates on a flexible pricing model, offering single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships, catering to a broad spectrum of customers.

Cyclistic’s business model focuses on providing flexible and affordable transportation options for various purposes, whether it's for leisure, commuting, or occasional use. The company serves a wide range of riders, with a significant portion using the bikes for daily commuting, while others opt for a more leisurely experience. As the company continues to expand, the marketing team is exploring ways to increase annual membership subscriptions, as they are more profitable compared to casual rides. With this goal in mind, Cyclistic is leveraging data analytics to understand customer behaviors, particularly the differences between casual riders and annual members, to design targeted marketing strategies aimed at boosting membership conversions.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

Prepare
Source
I will be using Cyclistic's trip data from Jan 2024 to Dec 2024 that can be downloaded from divvy_tripdata. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license.

Data
There are 12 files, each named using the format YYYYMM-divvy-tripdata, with each file containing data for a specific month. The data includes details such as the ride ID, bike type, start and end times, start and end stations, start and end locations, and the rider's membership status. The relevant columns in each file are ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id, start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, and member_casual.

Process
I used Bigquery to combine the datasets into one single tables, and clean it.

Column names and the data types

Check for null values in start_station_name and end_station_name
Image 2

Checking for null values in start_station_name and end_station_name is crucial because these columns represent the starting and ending points of bike trips, which are key to analyzing trip patterns, popular routes, and station usage.

Check for rides with duration less than 1 minutes
Image 3

Rides with a duration of less than 1 minute are typically considered outliers because they are unusually short for bike trips. Such durations might indicate errors in the data, like a ride being logged when a bike was checked out and immediately returned without being ridden, or it could represent a system glitch. In real-world scenarios, most bike rides, even short ones, tend to last longer than a minute, so durations under this threshold are often not meaningful and can skew the analysis if included. Identifying and handling these outliers helps ensure that the data accurately reflects typical bike usage.

Check for rides of more than 24 hours
Image

Same like rides with a duration less than 1 minute, rides lasting more than 24 hours are considered outliers. They are typically data errors, as bike trips rarely last that long. Including such rides can distort the analysis, so identifying and handling them ensures the data reflects normal usage.

Create a new table without rows having null station names The table named cleaned_combined_data Remaining rows, 5.860.568 - 1.652.259 = 4.208.309 Rows

Add and Update ride_length in minutes column

Create a new table without rows having ride lengths less than 1 minute or more than 24 hours (1440 Minutes) (Outliers) The table named final_cleaned_combined_data Remaining rows, 4.208.309 - 40.037 = 4.168.272

Add day and month columns

Image

Adding day and month columns helps analyze bike usage patterns by day of the week or season. Visualizing this data can reveal trends, like higher usage on weekends or specific months, allowing for better insights into demand and optimization strategies.

Check and delete duplicate ride_ids Deleting 242 rows
Image

The ride_id column contains unique identifiers for each bike ride, ensuring that each trip is recorded separately. If there are duplicate ride_id entries, it means that the same ride is being counted more than once, which can lead to inaccurate analysis. This duplication can artificially inflate ride counts, distort average ride durations, and skew other metrics like station usage or trip frequency. Identifying and removing duplicates ensures the integrity of the data, providing accurate insights into bike usage and helping avoid misleading conclusions.

Comparing Total Trips Members and Casual
Image

Members took the most rides with 63,87% (1.506.079 Trips) of the total trips compared to 36,13% (2662.193) for Casual

The key takeaway from the ride duration difference is that casual riders tend to use the service for more leisurely purposes, whereas members rely on it for more frequent, shorter trips.

Average Ride Length Members and Casual
Image Casual riders averaged 23,68 minutes per ride while Member riders averaged 12,06 minutes per rides.

This difference indicates that Casual riders typically take longer trips compared to Members, with casual trips being more than twice as long on average.

Bike Demand By Hour
Image This is when the demand peaks for both Members and Casual riders. The rush at 17:00 is especially notable for Members, likely reflecting the end of the workday or shift, when people are returning home or heading out for personal errands.

Since the peak demand time shows a clear gap between Casual and Member riders, the service could focus on converting more Casual riders into Members, particularly those who use the service during the busy times like 17:00.

Bike Demand Daily
Image

The busiest day in the week for Members were Tuesday to Thursday, and the busiest day for Casual were Friday to Sunday

This data reinforces the differing behavior between Members and Casual riders. Members are consistent users who rely on the service for daily activities, while Casual riders primarily use the bikes for leisure and recreational purposes, with demand peaking on weekends.

Bike Demand Monthly
Image

The busiest month in 2024 for both Members and Casual were July through September.

This aligns with the warmer months of the year during the summer, suggesting that weather plays a significant role in encouraging higher usage for both types of riders.

Marketing campaigns could leverage this peak period, offering seasonal promotions or discounts to attract more riders, particularly for Casual users who seem to ride more during these months. Partnerships with local attractions or events could also drive bike usage for Casual riders during the high season.

Offering membership incentives or discounts could encourage Casual riders to become Members and increase their commitment to regular usage.

Total Trips by Different Bike Types
Image

The classic bike is the most popular bike type for both Casual and Member.

The data shows data the electric scooters for Members were 21.673 users and the Casual were slightly more, 25.273 users. Marketing analyst team should identify where is the place to put marketing campaign and strategy.

Electric scooters are best suited for people who need a quick, convenient, and low-effort mode of transport for short distances, such as commuters, tourists, and students. They are also appealing to casual riders who want a fun and easy experience. To increase their usage, the bike-sharing service might consider positioning electric scooters in areas with high foot traffic, promoting them to specific user groups, or improving their availability during peak times.

Casual Type Riders That Rides More Than 2 times Standard Deviation
Image

Based on the data that 55,448 Casual riders are riding for more than 60 minutes, and the fact that they fall beyond 2 standard deviations of the average ride time, this presents an excellent opportunity for the marketing team to target these users and potentially convert them into Members.

The 55,448 Casual riders who consistently ride for more than 60 minutes represent a key opportunity for conversion into Members. By analyzing their behavior, location, date, and time, the marketing team can run targeted campaigns that specifically appeal to this group, offering discounts or tailored memberships to encourage them to make the switch. Focusing on high-traffic areas and peak times will ensure that these campaigns reach the right users and maximize the likelihood of conversion.

Top 10 Start Station Name for Casual

The Top 10 Start Station Names for Casual riders show that bikes are predominantly used in tourist areas and recreational hotspots. The stations with the highest total ride lengths are located near popular attractions like Millennium Park, Shedd Aquarium, and the waterfront, indicating that Casual riders are using bikes for longer, more leisurely trips. These insights can guide marketing strategies targeting tourists and recreational riders, as well as help with fleet management and membership promotions.

Based on the findings, here are the top 5 recommendations for Cyclistic to effectively convert Casual riders into Annual Members.

1. Target Marketing Campaigns During Peak Usage Times (17:00):

Promote membership benefits such as unlimited ride time or discounts on frequent usage. Additionally, special offers like trial memberships or free extended ride time for those using bikes during peak times could entice Casual riders to switch to a more economical membership.

2. Leverage Popular Tourist and Recreational Areas for Membership Promotions

Focus on targeted marketing campaigns in high-traffic tourist and recreational zones. Offer membership promotions tailored to tourists or leisure users, emphasizing the convenience and cost-effectiveness of an annual membership for frequent sightseeing or recreational trips. Consider partnerships with local attractions to offer exclusive membership discounts or special deals for people using bikes in these areas.

3. Promote Electric Bikes and Scooters for Casual Riders to Encourage Membership

Enhance the availability of electric bikes and electric scooters in tourist-heavy areas or places with high foot traffic. Offer discounted membership rates for electric bike and electric scooter users to promote longer rides at a lower cost. By making electric bikes and scooters a central part of membership packages, you could convert Casual riders into Members by aligning their preferred ride type with membership benefits.

4. Transforming Long-Ride Casual Riders into Loyal Members with Targeted Campaigns

The 55,448 Casual riders who regularly ride for over 60 minutes present a valuable opportunity for conversion into Members. By analyzing their behavior, location, and usage patterns, the marketing team can design targeted campaigns with personalized offers, discounts, and tailored memberships to effectively encourage this group to transition to annual membership.

5. Harnessing Digital Strategies to Promote Membership Among Casual Riders

Cyclistic can convert Casual riders into Members by using targeted digital campaigns on social media, highlighting the fun and convenience of biking, offering exclusive discounts, and leveraging influencers. Personalized email marketing, retargeting ads, and geolocation-based offers can further encourage conversions, especially near popular tourist spots. These strategies emphasize the value and convenience of an annual membership for Casual riders.
